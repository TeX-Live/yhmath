README for yhmath

This package contains the yhmath fonts and support files from
Yannis Haralambous, as well as the PostScript Type1 version of
the fonts.

It merges two former CTAN packages:
macros/latex/contrib/yhmath and fonts/yhmath

See the included pdf files for more details on changes.

The package also ships a Makefile, which allows installation into
an arbitrary texmf tree by
	DESTDIR=/path/to/some/texmf make install
If former files in the respective yhmath directories should be removed, use
	CLEANRM="rm -f" DESTDIR=/path/to/some/texmf make install
